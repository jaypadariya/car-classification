This claasification is based on Sub four meter/ lenth of the car.

Sub four meter is 4000 mm range.
if the car length is more than 4000mm, the cost will be higher so
it will not suitable for poor or small family.

if the Sub four meter/ car length is less than 4000 mm,
the car price will be lower and it has 5 seater capacity,
so it is suitable for small family.

so we have created here two claases in claasification, one is for the 
car length more than 4000mm and seating capacity more than5.
 anotherr claass is car length less than 4000 mm and car capacity 5 or less.
